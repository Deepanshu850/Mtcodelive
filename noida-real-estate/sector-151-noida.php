                <li><strong>Ventilation: </strong>This suggests that ventilation in these facilities is poor, and this may be going to affect the comfort of the residents besides the quality of the air they breathe.</li>
                <li><strong>Connectivity:</strong> The last one is connectivity which is an area of concern since the society lacks availability to public means of transport hence coming can be tiresome.</li>
                <li><strong>Limited openness for teenagers:</strong> The openness for the teenagers seems to be limited due to some criminal incidents that have occurred in the past and some residents may be limited in their interaction with other people.</li>
                <li><strong>Restrictions on partying: </strong>The society is not fit for people who love to party as there are restrictions placed in regards to partying and the available visitor&rsquo;s parking space is inadequate.</li>
