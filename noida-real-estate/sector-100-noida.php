            <h3>Great things about Sector 100 Noida </h3>

                <li><strong>Posh Residential Hub:</strong> ​ Sector 100 Noida consists of well-planned properties, which are targeted toward the budgets of various classes, starting from the affordable ones to high-end properties such as 3C Lotus Boulevard and Lotus Boulevard Espacia targeted at families and also at youth. </li>
                <li><strong>Excellent Connectivity:</strong> It is well-connected and is in close vicinity of major routes such as the Greater Noida Expressway, Yamuna Expressway, and DND Flyway, with which commuting to Delhi and other parts of Noida is relatively easy.</li>
                <li><strong>Amenities:</strong> It includes proximity to essential facilities such as quality schools, hospitals, and shopping complexes that promise a comfortable way of life. Major medical facilities include Ganpati Hospital Maternity Centre and Ojjus Hospital.</li>
                <li><strong>Greenery:</strong> The sector facilitates parks and open green spaces, hence motivating fitness goals through active lifestyles. Well-maintained parks offer flawless jogging and picnic spots.</li>
                <li><strong>Valuable Properties:</strong> Properties in Sector 100 Noida, with the average price being ₹10,450 per square foot, have gained huge appreciation in value and hence are good for investment for buyers and investors as well.</li>

            <h3>Things that need attention in Sector 100 Noida </h3>

            <ul class="arrow-list">
                <li><strong>Traffic Congestion:</strong> Heavy traffic in this sector is almost full and reaches its peak at special times of the day, which might affect travelling time and hence make the commute not as easy as it needs to be for the people.</li>
                <li><strong>Public transportation:</strong> The surrounding sector has a metro station in <a href="./sector-101-noida.php"><strong>Sector 101 Noida</strong></a> and one more in <a href="./sector-76-noida.php"><strong>Sector 76 Noida</strong></a>, although a bit more public transport facility options would have made it more accessible than being a problem in the vicinity.</li>
                <li><strong>Competitiveness of the rental market:</strong> The rentals are highly competitive. In highly demanded properties, such as Lotus Boulevard, a sought-after price of 1 BHK or 2 BHK is beyond the reach of many aspirants&#39; budgets.</li>
                <li><strong>Infrastructure Development:</strong> Further development of infrastructure may be better connectivity of roads or public transport and needs to continue for the area to grow more and develop further.</li>
                <li><strong>Air Quality Management:</strong> Along with city growth, there is a need to monitor and manage air quality properly so that the AQI in Sector 100 Noida remains within the comfortable limit of the residents.</li>
