                <li>Nearness to Metro: A metro station proposed in the area of Noida Sector 156 would allow easy accessibility to workplaces or even fun travel shortly.</li>
                <li>Multiple Property Options: The location has options for different types of properties and can be chosen from residential flats and apartments to industrial plots for sale according to the choice of a buyer.</li>
                <li>Good educational institutes like Amity University and Sharda University are in proximity, thus this place makes it an attractive location for families.</li>
                <li>Affordable Realty: Sector 156 Noida homes are priced with competitiveness, and the maximum property prices fall under ₹50 lacs. It becomes very irresistible for first-time homebuyers.</li>
                <li>Infrastructure Development: The sector is going through rigorous infrastructure development which would bring in the latest amenities within an arm&#39;s distance of its residents. This would mean hospitals and shopping centres closer to home.</li>

            <h3>Things that need attention in Sector 156 Noida </h3>

            <ul class="arrow-list">
                <li>Work Under Process: While it is good that the infrastructure network is coming up, some areas have work under process. It makes for temporary nuisances like noise and traffic disruption.</li>
