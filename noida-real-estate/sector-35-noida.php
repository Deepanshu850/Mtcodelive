The access and sight lines to this development are fantastic. With three sides of access and overly generous visibility along the site&rsquo;s perimeter, the layout and structural presence of Paras Avenue serves quite well the interior spaces that are occupied by a number of delightful court food brands, hypermarkets, and various retail concerns.</p>
