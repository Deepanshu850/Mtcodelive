                A peek inside Mahesh Babu's Luxurious House in Jubilee Hills, Hyderabad
            </h1>


            <h2>Introduction | Mahesh Babu, Prominent Actor in Indian Cinema </h2>

            <p>Mahesh Babu is one of the most successful and highest-paid actors in Tollywood, who has been featured in Forbes India&#39;s Celebrity 100 list since 2012. Mahesh Babu is a talented actor and is sought-after by many brands, he also charges a substantial amount for each project, which adds to his wealth.</p>

Mahesh was born In Madras Tamil Nadu and had upbringing under his maternal grandmother, and the rest of the family. Mahesh Babu made his debut as the lead in the 1999 comedy film, <em>Rajakumarudu</em>, for which he received the Nandi Award for Best Male Debut. Since then he has worked in many films and won various awards. </p>

            <p>However, his success came with setbacks, as his jubilee home was raided by the income tax department, after his film <em>Dookudu</em> crossed the ₹100 crore mark, ( making it the highest-grossing film of that year), which fueled the rumor that he was going to receive more than 12 crore for his next projects. </p>

            <h3>The Study Room </h3>
