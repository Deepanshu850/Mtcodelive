                A Glimpse into Rashmika Mandanna's Serene Abode

            </h1>


            <h2>An introduction To Rashmika mandanna </h2>

            <h3>Early life</h3>

            <p>Rashmika Mandanna is an Indian actress who was born on 5 April 1996, in a small town Virajpet, a town in Kodagu district, Karnataka. She comes from a modest family, her father owns a coffee estate and a function hall while her mother is a homemaker. She has a younger sister, Shiman, whom she loves and raised like a mother. </p>

            <p>While growing up her family faced financial problems, and had a hard time paying rent. She is someone who grew up struggling with money, not having the luxury to buy the things she wanted, an experience that taints her relationship with money, and how she lives her life. </p>

            <p>Mandanna had a hard time growing up, she struggled to communicate with her peers, which made it difficult for her to make friends. Her mother was her constant support, in this difficult part of her life.</p>

            <h3>The start of a successful career.</h3>

            <p>Madonna&#39;s career started when she won <em>The Times of India</em>&#39;s Clean &amp; Clear Fresh Face, which led to her becoming the brand ambassador of Clean and Clear, which led to a brief career in modeling. Her parents were reluctant for her to become an actress, due to her introverted personality, but agreed later. She made her acting debut with the Kannada romantic comedy <em>Kirik Party</em> (2016), and got engaged with her co-star Rakshit Shetty, after dating him briefly, although they broke the engagement a year later due to compatibility issues. </p>

            <p>She has worked in several Telugu, Kannada, Hindi, and Tamil films and is dubbed as South India&#39;s highest-paid actress as of now. She gained even more popularity with the successful film <em>Pushpa: The Rise</em> (2021). </p>

            <p>Despite not being in the industry for a long time, Mandanna has made a name for herself and has won several awards such as Best Debut Actress &ndash; Kannada, four SIIMA Awards, and a Filmfare Award. She has also been featured in <em>Forbes India</em>&#39;s 2024 list of &quot;30 Under 30&quot;. </p>

            <p>Despite rising to such a success Mandanna remains to be down to earth. She is not just beautiful, but smart, intelligent, and empathetic which allows her to connect to her audience on a deeper level. </p>

            <p>Rashmika&rsquo;s net worth is <em>Rs 45 crore</em> and is reported to demand at least 65 lakhs for each film. </p>

            <p>Rashmika Mandanna has invested in several properties across India such as Goa, Coorg, Mumbai, Bangalore, and Hyderabad. Mandanna is someone who knows the value of a good investment and the importance of having a place one could call their own. </p>

            <h2>A tour of Mandanna house in Virajpet, Karnataka</h2>

            <h3>A serene location</h3>

            <p>Mandanna owns a beautiful single-story bungalow in her birthplace, Virajpet, Karnataka, her hometown. The house has a beautiful location, and greenery cradles it from all sides. The house is surrounded by thick trees that not only give it a serene ambiance but also keep the house cool during summer. The estimated cost of the house is around 8 crore. And for Rashmika who loves nature, this is the perfect place to have a reprieve from her busy filming schedules. </p>

            <h3>The outside architecture </h3>

            <p>The house has a contemporary design and has a beautiful patio, adorned with various plants and flowers. The house gives a British cottage vibe, with striped fences all around and mid-length stone compound walls, along the perimeter of the house, which not only makes it pretty but also acts as a privacy measure for the actress. A big iron gate completes the suburban house look, and a white pergola, by making a shadowy passageway adds more charm to the house. </p>

            <p>The stone walls are decorated with numerous flower pots that add vibrant hues to the garden area, while a gazebo draped with vines and white stone flooring makes the house look like something from a fairytale. </p>

            <p>There is also an intricate iron swing in her garden (whose heart doesn&rsquo;t soar at the sight of a swing?), while the house is surrounded by tall palm trees. Rashmika has also hung a cute little white birdhouse, which makes the environment even cuter. </p>

            <p>The house itself is pretty with a neo-classical look, large French doors, and a patio (surrounded by even more plants) featuring pillars that support a triangular roof. And Rashmika&rsquo;s luxury cars are parked in the front courtyard </p>

            <p>Rashmika Mandanna has a great love for nature which is evident in the design of her house that she has named &lsquo;serenity&rsquo;, and in my opinion, the house definitely lives up to its name.</p>

            <h3>Interiors of serenity</h3>

            <p>Now we have seen how pretty the exterior of Mandanna&rsquo;s house is, it&rsquo;s time to look at the beautiful interiors. Mandanna&rsquo;s house design is perfectly balanced, with an outside full of greenery and an inside that is warm and inviting with cool tones and wooden furniture, fixtures, and large glass windows to let the sunshine in. </p>

            <h3>The Dining Room</h3>

            <p>Everything about Mandanna&rsquo;s home screams princess fairytale. This is evident in her dining room, with lavender walls and modern wooden furniture that balances the whole look. The dining room overlooks the living room, through a large glass window. The walls are decorated with paintings completing the whole look of the space. While the different shade of brown furniture makes the room look classy. </p>

            <h3>The Living Room</h3>

            <p>The living room of Mandanna&rsquo;s household is lavish, with three opulent chandeliers gracing the ceiling of the room creating an interesting pattern. Rashmika has chosen wooden chick blinds in place of regular curtains. And modern painting adds color and glamour to the minimalistic decor of the living room area. A flower-shaped chandelier also adds glamour to the living space. The living room is also a place where Mandanna plays with her fur babies</p>

            <h3>The kitchen</h3>

            <p>The kitchen of &lsquo;Serenity&rsquo; is a modern marvel, with state-of-the-art modern appliances and sleek countertops. The house is equipped with all the amenities and facilities for a comfortable life. </p>

            <h3>The Makeup Room</h3>

            <p>Mandana has a chic makeup room with light pink color walls with a subdued pattern and plenty of light fixtures to light up the room. The room also has wooden hangers and hooks for easy laundry organization.</p>

            <p>Mandanna&rsquo;s wooden closet is expansive with floor-to-ceiling mirror pane, perfect for the actress who has a great wardrobe collection and loves spontaneous photoshoots. </p>

            <h3>The balcony</h3>

            <p>The view from Mandanna&rsquo;s balcony is breathtaking, with not just the view of her own garden, but the area around her home. Her home is surrounded by greenery and mountains. So when she looks out of her balcony what she enjoys is a beautiful expanse of peace. It is the perfect place to enjoy sunsets and sunrises and enjoy a relaxing evening away from the hustle and bustle of the city. </p>

            <h2>Rashmika Mandanna&rsquo;s house in Mumbai</h2>

            <p>Rashmika Mandanna bought her house in Mumbai while she was shooting for &lsquo;Mission Majnu&rsquo;, her first Bollywood film, to avoid the hassle of hostel accommodation and constant travel. </p>

            <p>She bought an apartment in the Ahuja Tower, in Worli, which is one of the most opulent areas of Mumbai and numerous actors and actresses live in the same tower.</p>

            <p> Rashmika has a grand balcony that has a beautiful view of the Arabian Sea and the Mumbai skyscrapers. A perfect place for the actress who has a deep love for nature and prefers peace. The place also lets the actress have easy access to work, which makes it all the better. The apartment is characterized by neutral shades like beige and creme. She has put on creamy curtains on the large windows and has decorated the room with simple yet modern furniture and a beige couch. The house is decorated with beautiful paintings and ornate hanging lamps. </p>

            <p>In an interview, Rashmika said that she loves her apartment in Mumbai and instantly fell in love with the place. She loves the sunlight and the view the apartment has to offer and loves the earthy-boho vibes that the place gives. </p>

            <h2>Rashmika Mandanna&rsquo;s house in Goa</h2>

            <p>Rashmika has recently bought her fourth house in Goa which she announced on her Instagram with the caption &quot;When you have a new home in Goa. jealous much?&quot;. This is indeed a reason to envy as she has homes in such beautiful places surrounded by greenery. Besides Goa is a destination where even working seems like fun, with its palm trees, sea air, and chill people. </p>

            <p>The place also has a pool surrounded by greenery and a stone Buddha statue beside it. </p>

            <p>One thing that all places of Rashmika have in common is that it is surrounded by nature. </p>

            <p>Her love for nature is finite and no one can deny that. </p>
