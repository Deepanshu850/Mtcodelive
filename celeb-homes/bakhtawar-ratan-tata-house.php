Each of these celebrity mansions have their own distinct characteristics and quality but none of them quite captures the simplicity of the Ratan Tata House that still remains an iconic building at the luxury locality of Mumbai. Let&rsquo;s take a look inside the various <strong>celebrity homes </strong>in Mumbai to understand their stark contrast with Tata residence.</p>

            <p>Antilia| The Ambani Residence : Covering approximately 400,000 square feet of area, Antilia boasts twenty seven floors and multiple swimming pools. It also hosts a health spa, garage that can accommodate up to 168 cars and a lavish ballroom.</p>

            <p>Jalsa| The Bachchan House: Covering a striking 10,000 square feet of land, Jalsa is a beauty to behold that features amenities like home theatres and guest suites. While it is a luxurious residence, Jalsa also exudes a rather welcoming and homely ambience.</p>

            <p>Galaxy Apartments| House of Salman Khan: The building showcases a contemporary design and comprises various amenities. It has multiple floors each for a different family member and hosts a gym and a swimming pool.</p>
