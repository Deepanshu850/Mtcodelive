            </h1>

            <h2>Quick Insight on Kriti Sanon </h2>

            <h3>Kriti Sanon&rsquo;s Moving Journey </h3>

            <p>One could describe Kriti Sanon&#39;s journey from a model to National Film Award-winning actress as quite an inspirational tale of passion and perseverance. Born into a Punjabi family, Kriti did her Bachelor&#39;s degree in Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering from Jaypee Institute of Information Technology, Noida, but the creative hearts were way ahead of engineering. Her stunning presence and talent soon opened doors to Bollywood, where she made her debut with the film<em> &lsquo;Heropanti&rsquo; </em>in 2014. Kriti&rsquo;s performance in the movie was widely appreciated, marking the beginning of a successful acting career. Over the years, she showcased her versatility in diverse roles, starring in hit films like<em> &lsquo;Bareilly Ki Barfi&rsquo;</em> and <em>&lsquo;Mimi&rsquo;</em>. It was the later, however, which earned her critical acclaim throughout for portraying a surrogate mother to win a further prize: the National Film Award for Best Actress.</p>

            <p>Off-screen, she is loved for her chic style and fondness for animals; with a luxurious Mumbai duplex shared with her sister Nupur and the adorable puppy, Disco, exuding a warm elegance vibe. From having walked ramps during modeling days, Kriti is now one of Bollywood&#39;s most celebrated actresses and a testament to defiance and one&#39;s innate talent.</p>

            <h3>The Appeal of Celebrity Homes: Why Kriti&#39;s Stands Out </h3>

            <p>The allure of celebrity homes lies in their ability to reflect the personality, lifestyle, and success of the stars who live in them.

Kriti Sanon&rsquo;s Mumbai duplex stands out for its tasteful blend of elegance and warmth. Decorated with chic interiors and personalized touches, it reflects her sophisticated style and love for comfort. Sharing the space with her sister Nupur and her beloved puppy Disco, Kriti&#39;s home exudes a welcoming and relatable charm, making it as endearing as the actress herself.</p>

            <h3>Budget-Friendly Hacks for Achieving a Luxe Look </h3>

            <p>Achieving a luxe look doesn&#39;t have to come with a hefty price tag. Here are some budget-friendly hacks:<br />
                Invest in a few statement pieces like a stylish sofa, a striking lamp, or a unique coffee table. These items can elevate the entire room without overwhelming your budget. Instead of buying expensive artwork, frame your own photography or create custom art. Personalizing your walls with budget-friendly frames can make a space feel much more expensive.<br />
                Opt for faux wood finishes for furniture or wall treatments instead of real wood or high-end materials, consider faux. These materials look just as chic and are much more affordable. Further, in place of buying all new furniture, consider reupholstering old pieces or adding new cushions to refresh the look of your living space. This small change can give your furniture a luxe feel without the cost of replacements.</p>
