                Rishabh Pant | A glimpse into the house of the Explosive wicketkeeper
            </h1>



            <h2>Introduction of Rishab Pant&rsquo;s early life and career</h2>

            <p>Rishabh Pant is an Indian international cricketer born in Roorkee in 1997, to Rajendra Pant and Saroj Pant. Rishabh also has an elder sister, whom he seems to adore and respect. Pant always had a keen interest in cricket and would travel with his mother to Delhi on weekends to train with Tarak Sinha at the Sonnet Cricket Academy. While he tried to play U13 and U15 cricket, despite all attempts, the outcome was unsuccessful. However, Things took a big turn for him when he was playing U-19 cricket for Delhi against Assam. </p>

            <p> Rishabh&rsquo;s success story begins from the day he was selected in December 2015 for the 2016 under-19 cricket World Cup, in which he was chosen as the vice-captain. Rishabh also won a Ranji Trophy in 2015, scoring a triple-century against Maharashtra. He became widely recognized after he won the ICC Emerging Player of the Year award at the 2018 ICC Awards in January 2019, and marked himself as an exceptional player.</p>

            <p> He plays as a wicketkeeper-batter for the Indian cricket team. He played for Delhi Capital for a significant time before that. He is not just an excellent batsman but also an outstanding wicketkeeper. As of the 2025 IPL auction, he was sold at a staggering 27 crore as the highest-sold player, to the Lucknow super giant in the Indian Premier League (IPL) even after his 2-year break after the lethal car accident, which just determines how valuable he is as a cricket player. </p>

            <p>Rishabh Pant&rsquo;s net worth is estimated to be around 70 crore Rs. While Rishabh&rsquo;s primary source of income and wealth is cricket, he also gets a substantial amount from brand endorsements which contributes to his financial portfolio. Rishabh&rsquo;s popularity has grown worldwide recently which has significantly increased his net worth and brand value. Rishabh Pant&rsquo;s overall net worth has increased by 40 % in the past years. Solidifying his growing fame in his exceptional batting and wicketing skills. </p>

            <h3>The Philanthropist</h3>

            <p>Rishabh Pant is not only great on the field but also a great man outside of it. During COVID-19 which was a tough time for everyone, many people lost someone they loved, Rishabh Pant donated funds to Hemkunt Foundation, an organization dedicated to providing critical COVID-19 relief. His donation helped in securing essential supplies, including oxygen cylinders, beds, and relief kits for people who were struggling with the lack of supplies and funds during this difficult time. His act of kindness helped many in a great time of trouble when it was difficult to get necessary things. These selfless acts of kindness and compassion not only show his values but also how inherently benevolent and empathetic Rishabh Pant is. </p>

            <p>It also serves as a great example for everyone with an influential position and significance that can make a great impact on the lives of people. </p>

            <h2>The house on the hill</h2>

            <h3>A serene Location</h3>

            <p>Rishabh Pant owns property in different locations such as Delhi, Roorkee, Dehradun, and Haridwar. However, his primary residence is his Roorkee home, in the cantonment district, where he resides with his sister and mother. He is often seen sharing pictures of his Roorkee home on Instagram, his love for this place and its people is palpable. His Roorkee home used to serve as a school run by his father before he had a cardiac arrest and passed away in 2017. Roorkee is a town full of history and has a certain calm serenity about it. It is one of the oldest cantonments, and it was established in 1803. The place is cradled in greenery, away from the hustle and bustle of the big cities. It is a perfect place to enjoy peaceful moments after a hectic gaming schedule that the cricketer has. And For Rishabh Pant who was born and raised in this place, it is a place that offers comfort and familiarity for him. After all, who doesn&rsquo;t want to be rooted in some way, to the place and people they&rsquo;ve always known? </p>

            <h3>Architectural Style of the Roorkee Home</h3>

            <p>While Rishabh Pant might be a fierce player on the field, his home is an image of simplicity. His home is a blend of comfort and modernity. His house is a modest two-story building With a value estimated to be around Rs 60 lakh to Rs 1 crore. The house also features a big lawn, with trees and bushes adding to its charm, while a red brick interlocked path adds a clean look to the place.</p>

            <p>Rishabh&rsquo;s house is just as simple as he is, a true reflection of his personality. His living room is fitted with a simple maroon sofa that compliments the hardwood floor. While a built-in shelf showcases all his trophies and medals, a reminder of his achievements. (Probably his proud mom showcasing her kid&rsquo;s achievements). The living room also has a small fish tank and a simple yet classy glass center table, which is decorated with some wooden coasters, and a small flower pot.</p>

            <p>The most modern part of the house is probably Rishabh&rsquo;s room which is designed in clean geometric patterns in royal blue color. </p>

            <p>Pant&rsquo;s lifestyle and career demands a strict workout routine (and rumor has it that Pant enjoys working out) therefore, Rishabh Pant has a home Gym that is well equipped and features light green walls and flowy white curtains, contemporary paintings, and large mirrors. If it wasn&rsquo;t for the gym equipment and motivational quotes, one could easily mistake this room for the set of a romantic movie, that is how beautifully dreamy his Gym room is. </p>

            <p>Apart from cricket, Pant also loves to play snooker and has a full-size pool table in his home, which he often uses to play games with his friends and family. </p>

            <p>The home is characterized by simple lines and a touch of wooden accents that add warmth to the place. </p>
