                Sourav Ganguly House: A Look inside the Grand House of the BCCI President
            </h1>


            <h2>Quick Insight on Sourav Ganguly&rsquo;s legacy </h2>

            <p>Sourav Ganguly, fondly called &#39;Dada,&#39; is a cricketing icon whose origins hail from the vibrant Behala locality of Kolkata. Born on July 8, 1972, to a decently well-off family, Sourav has spent all 51 years of his life in the same family house, which for the Ganguly family has been the family address since over six-and-a-half decades.</p>

            <p>It is here that young Sourav, along with his elder brother Snehasish, learned to play cricket under the watchful eyes of his father, Chandidas Ganguly, on a concrete wicket. This small beginning at his house, which the locals fondly have named the &#39;Tiger&#39;s Den,&#39; would be the starting point for Sourav&#39;s historic rise into one of India&#39;s finest cricket captains.</p>

            <p>Synonymous with leadership, resilience, and a passion that could not be equaled anywhere in the world, Sourav&#39;s legacy extends beyond Bengal.
