Set against the verdant backdrop of the Aravali Valley, it provides facilities including a rooftop infinity lap pool, private lifts, a business centre and concierge service. It offers a healthy living environment due to its low Air Quality Index (AQI). With its ideal location close to the Gurgaon-Faridabad Expressway, Golf Course Road, and IGI Airport, Paras Quartier is a desirable place to buy real estate since it offers easy access to South Delhi and other locations.</p>
