            <h2>Crucial Highlights of Sector 28 Gurgaon </h2>

            <h3>Great things about Sector 28 Gurgaon </h3>

            <ul class="arrow-list">
                <li>Sector 28 Gurgaon features well-placed along the Golf Course Road, National Highway-48 (NH-48), and Mehrauli-Gurgaon Road (NH 148A). Hence, connectivity can be ensured anywhere in Gurgaon as well as Delhi. This will enable easy movement of people towards office places or nearby cities.</li>
                <li>The locality is 6 km from DLF Cyber Hub-the largest of its kind-the business district which has housed several MNCs. Similarly, proximity to other large companies along Golf Course Road has made Sector 28 a hub for professionals looking to be close to their workplaces.</li>
                <li>Three metro stations along the Yellow Line also provide a significant boost: MG Road, IFFCO Chowk and Sikanderpur stations. The locality is also well connected through the Rapid Metro line to the Phase I station, which enhances intra-city travel within Gurgaon business hubs such as DLF Cyber City and Golf Course Road.</li>
                <li>There are several big real estate developing companies like Suncity Projects, Silverglades, and Espace. They have launched various high-end residential projects in Sector 28 that suit the needs of the homebuyers who look for readymade homes.</li>
                <li>Indira Gandhi International Airport, which is 15 km away from Sector 28, is easily reachable by taking NH-48. It makes it a good place for people who have to travel more for their work or business.</li>
                <li>A state-level report has identified Sector 28 as one of the smallest pedestrian-friendly locations in Gurgaon and thus safe and accessible walking paths for its residents for a better quality of life.</li>
                <li>Leisure and hospitality are catered to by major hotel chains such as Taj City Centre, The Palms Town and Country Club, and The Pllazio Hotel, where people can spend a comfortable stay in its stylish accommodations and other recreational amenities.</li>
                <li>Kingdom of Dreams, Appu Ghar are major tourist destinations, located some 5 kilometers away from the area, thus an entertainment and cultural related experiences for its residential group.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Things that need attention in Sector 28 Gurgaon </h3>

            <ul class="arrow-list">
                <li>Frequent submergence of underpasses on Golf Course Road during Monsoons: Being a main road, Golf Course Road experiences waterlogging most often-underpasses, especially during the monsoon season. This stressed drainage system cannot cope with constant heavy rain and results in a massive flood. It caused severe traffic congestion, longer commutes, and inconvenience for residents and office-goers on their way there.</li>

                <li>Even though Golf Course Road is an important arterial road connecting prime business centers with residential regions, it is still marred by potholes and uneven road surfaces. It is slowly slowing down traffic besides increasing vehicle maintenance through wear and tear to the vehicles.</li>

                <li>MG Road is another key stretch in Gurgaon, which suffers from a severe problem of the encroachment of footpaths and pavements. Vendors, parked vehicles, and illegal structures occupy pedestrian spaces, thereby making it difficult for pedestrians to walk on the road freely. This makes pedestrians walk on the roads and increase the chances of accidents, creating further congestion on the roads</li>
                <li>Because of frequent power cuts in Gurgaon and an unpredictable supply of electricity, many households, businesses, and commercial entities in Sector 28 use diesel generators (gen-sets). Although gen-sets assure uninterrupted power supply, they also generate serious air and noise pollution. </li>
            </ul>
