                    <p>Before diving into commercial vs residential property, let&rsquo;s understand the basics of commercial and residential properties, their subtypes, and usage:</p>

                    <h3>What is a commercial property? </h3>

It acts as a fantastic investment opportunity in real estate with a promising high ROI. Commercial spaces include retail shops, food courts, high-street avenues, shopping malls, multiplexes, and office spaces, among others.</p>

                    <p>To tap on the potential of real estate bloom in India, <a href="./top-10-real-estate-company-in-noida"><strong>leading real estate developers</strong></a> such as DLF Limited, Paras Buidtech, M3M Group, Piramal Realty, Mahindra Realty, Elan Group, Godrej Properties, etc. have initiated their top-notch commercial projects in various strategic locations across the country, offering high-end amenities and favourable rental yields.</p>
