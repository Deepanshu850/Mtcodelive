                    <h3>Purpose and Usage </h3>

                    <p>Let&rsquo;s differentiate commercial property vs residential property on the basis of purpose and usage:</p>

                    <ul class="arrow-list">

                            <p><strong>Commercial Property</strong></p>

                            <p>Commercial properties are designed for conducting business activities, such as retail spaces, high-street avenues, office spaces, food courts, multiplexes, industrial facilities, etc. It is ideal for people looking for a space to run their business-related errands or seek income from tenants.</p>

                        </li>
                        <li>

                            <p><strong>Residential Property</strong></p>

                            <p>Residential properties are typically used as living spaces for individuals and families. Types of residential apartments include studio apartments, 2 BHK, 3 BHK, and 4 BHK apartments, penthouses, duplexes, and independent homes/villas.</p>
