                    <p>
                        <strong>RERA approved</strong> is a layman term for a real estate project that has acquired the mandatory papers and approval from the state real estate regulatory to build a property for sale.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The term ‘RERA Approved’ is often used by builders and <strong>channel partners</strong> in real estate in their <strong>sales and marketing strategies</strong>.
                        <strong>RERA registered</strong> or <strong>RERA Certified</strong> is an official term used to denote a property for sale that is registered under the state’s real estate regulatory authority. After the enactment of the <strong>RERA Act, 2016</strong>, each builder with an area of property more than 500 sq m, needs to register that property under the state's RERA before starting marketing the real estate project.
                        <br><br>
                        <strong>‘RERA approved’ and ‘RERA registered’</strong> are often used interchangeably in day-to-day usage but in fact they are different terms. It is advised to buyers to do due diligence and analyse the project details on the official RERA website before making a real estate investment.

                                The provisions in the RERA Act set the standard definition of ‘Carpet Area’ across every real estate project. It restricted promoters to asking for increased prices based on inflated carpet areas.
