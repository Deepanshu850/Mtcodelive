                    Let’s say you have 5 sq meters of land, and you want to convert that piece of land into sq feet, for that you just need to multiply 5 sq meters by 10.764.


                    <br><br>
                    Square feet = (5) x 10.764 = 53.82.

                    <br><br>
                    Therefore, 5 Square meters of land/plot would be approximately equal to 53.82 sq feet.
