                </h3>
                <p>
                    Let’s say you have 5 bighas of land, and you want to convert that piece of land/plot into Hectares, for that you just need to multiply 5 bighas by 0.251.


                    <br>
                    Hectare = (5) x 0.251 = 1.225

                    <br>

                    Therefore, a 5 bighas of land/plot would be approximately equal to 1.225 Hectares.
