                <p>
                    Let’s say you have 5 acres of land, and you want to convert that piece of land/plot into
                    bigha, for that you just need to multiply 5 Acres by 1.613.
                    <br>

                    Bigha = (5) x 1.613 = 8.067

                    <br>
                    Therefore, a 5 acres of land/plot would be approximately equal to 8.067 bigha.
