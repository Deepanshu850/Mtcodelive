                <p>
                    Let’s say you have 50 meters of land, and you want to convert that piece of land/plot into CM, for that you just need to multiply 50 meters by 100.

                    <br>

                    CM = (50) x 100 = 5,000


                    <br>
                    Therefore, 50 meters of land/plot would be approximately equal to 5,000 CM.

                    A centimeter is a metric unit for the measurement of the length of objects and small distances. It is written using the symbol cm. It can also be defined as the unit of length in the International System of Units (SI), the current form of the metric system. It is equivalent to 1/100 meters.
