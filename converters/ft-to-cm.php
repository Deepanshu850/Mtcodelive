                <p>The human foot is a strong and complex mechanical structure containing 26 bones, 33 joints and more than a hundred muscles, tendons, and ligaments. The joints of the foot are the ankle and subtalar joints and the interphalangeal joints of the foot.</p>

                <p>Centimetres are metric units of measurement that are useful for measuring the lengths of small objects, just like the imperial unit of foot. Centimetres are smaller than feet; it takes 38.4&nbsp; centimetres to equal 1 foot. There are 100 centimetres in 1 meter, and there are 10 millimetres in each centimetre.</p>

                        To convert feet to centimeters, multiply the number of feet by 30.48. The formula is: Feet = Feet × 30.48 = Centimeters. <br>
