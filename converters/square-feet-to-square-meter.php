                <p>Let&rsquo;s say you have 5 Square Feet of the wall, and you want to convert that piece of land/plot into Square meters, for that you just need to multiply 5 Square feet by 10.7<br />
                    Square Foot = (5) x 10.7 = 53.5</p>

                <p>Therefore, 5 Square Feet of land/plot is approximately equal to 53.5 meters.</p>
