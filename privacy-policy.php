            Dispute Resolution and Jurisdiction
        </h3>
        <p>
            In the case of any legal dispute arising from this Policy and attached Terms and
            Conditions, the Parties shall take up a two-step alternative dispute resolution (ADR)
            process. This section will survive the expiration or termination of this Policy and the
            Terms and Conditions.

        </p>
        <h4>
            Step 1: Amicable Resolution Through Mediation

        </h4>
        <p>
            In the event of any dispute, the Parties undertake to proceed immediately into
            negotiations for an equitable settlement of that particular dispute. Failing cooperative
            agreement, within thirty (30) days after one Party has notified the other in writing of the
            existence of such a dispute, the matter shall be referred further.

        </p>
        <h4>
            Step 2: Binding Arbitration Process

        </h4>

        <p>
            If the matter remains unresolved in mediation, it shall be escalated for further
            proceedings. The company would subsequently appoint a sole arbitrator as the head
            of the arbitration process. The arbitrator's decision shall be final and valid upon both
            Parties and the parties shall bear the costs of the proceeding.
            This arbitration process shall be conducted in the English language, and the place
            of arbitration shall be Noida.
        </p>

        <h4>
            Governing Law and Jurisdiction

        </h4>
        <p>
            The Parties hereto agree that this Policy and the Terms, including all other agreements,
            are ruled by Indian law. Exclusive jurisdiction in any dispute arising out of this Policy
            and these Terms and Conditions shall vest in the Courts at Noida.
